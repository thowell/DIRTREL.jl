# DIRTREL.jl

This repository provides a basic implementation of [DIRTREL: Robust Trajectory Optimization with Ellipsoidal Disturbances and LQR Feedback](https://agile.seas.harvard.edu/files/agile/files/dirtrel.pdf) written in Julia.

The following robust trajectory optimization problem is solved,
```
minimize        lw(X,U) + l(X,U)
  X,U,H
subject to      x+ = f(x,u,h)
                x1 = x(x0)
                xT = x(T)
                ul < u < uu
                xl < x < xu
                ul < uw < uu
                xl < xw < xu
                hl < h < hu             
```
where for simplicity, all constraints (apart from dynamics) are linear bounds
and the object is,
```
l(X,U) = (x-xT)'QT(x-xT) + h Σ {(x-xt)'Qt(x-xt) + (u-ut)'Rt(u-ut)}
```
